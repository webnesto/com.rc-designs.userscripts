User Scripts
======
**User Scripts** is a collection of my userscripts for Chrome / Firefox (w/ GreaseMonkey)


## Download
* Feel free to download the bundle or pick and choose.

## Usage
```$ git clone https://github.com/webnesto/com.rc-designs.userscripts.git
...```

Alternatively, install directly from script path - if you have GreaseMonkey or TamperMonkey, browse to scripts/script-you-want-to-install.user.js and then click "Raw" - you should be prompted to install the script.

Love,
